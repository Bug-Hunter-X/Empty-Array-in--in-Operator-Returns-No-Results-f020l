# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The expected behavior is to return all documents when the array is empty, but MongoDB interprets it as no match.

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation. The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct approach to handle empty arrays to return all documents.

## Problem

When using `{$in: []}`, MongoDB interprets this as a criteria that will never match, effectively returning an empty result set. This is often unexpected behavior.  The solution involves a conditional check to handle empty arrays appropriately.

## Solution

The provided solution includes a conditional check to determine if the array is empty. If the array is empty, it bypasses the `$in` clause in the query, allowing all documents to be returned.
